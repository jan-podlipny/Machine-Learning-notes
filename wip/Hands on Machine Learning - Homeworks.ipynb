    "Part I. The Fundamentals of Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Exercises:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How would you define Machine Learning?\n",
    "  - Process of computer program learning from Experience on some Task and some performance measure, if performance P on task       T improves with experience E.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Can you name four types of problems where it shines?\n",
    "  - when problem requires complex rules\n",
    "  - when there is no known algorithm (speech recognition)\n",
    "  - Fluctuating environments:Machine learning system can adapt to new data\n",
    "  - getting insights about complex problem and large amounts of data\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is a labeled training set?\n",
    "  - it is a part of data set designated to be train on, with some sort of meaningful tag on it, \n",
    "\n",
    "4. What are the two most common supervised tasks?\n",
    "  - logistic regression\n",
    "  - decision trees and random forests\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Can you name four common unsupervised tasks?\n",
    "  - Principal component analysis (dimensionality reduction)\n",
    "  - Apriori (association rules making)\n",
    "  - k-Means (clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What type of Machine Learning algorithm would you use to allow a robot to walk in various unknown terrains?\n",
    "  - Reinforcement learning\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What type of algorithm would you use to segment your customers into multiple groups?\n",
    "  - Clustering algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Would you frame the problem of spam detection as a supervised learning problem or an unsupervised learning problem?\n",
    "  - supervised learning\n",
    "  \n",
    "9. What is an online learning system?\n",
    "  - system that can continuosly learn from stream of data\n",
    "  \n",
    "10. What is out-of-core learning?\n",
    "  - used when memory of main machine is not big enough, learning is done on part of data, then trained, and then it starts learning on another part of data again\n",
    "  \n",
    "11. What type of learning algorithm relies on a similarity measure to make predictions?\n",
    "  - k-nearest-neighbors\n",
    "  \n",
    "12. What is the difference between a model parameter and a learning algorithmâ€™s hyperparameter?\n",
    "  - Model parameters are the properties of the training data that are learnt during training by the classifier or other ml model. For example in case of some NLP task: word frequency, sentence length, noun or verb distribution per sentence, the number of specific character n-grams per word, lexical diversity, etc. Model parameters differ for each experiment and depend on the type of data and task at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Model hyperparameters, on the other hand, are common for similar models and cannot be learnt during training but are set beforehand. A typical set of hyperparameters for NN include the number and size of the hidden layers, weight initialization scheme, learning rate and its decay, dropout and gradient clipping threshold, etc.\n",
    "   \n",
    "13. What do model-based learning algorithms search for? What is the most common strategy they use to succeed? How do they make predictions?\n",
    "  - they search for patterns in data,find a decision boundary and split data based on some function\n",
    "  \n",
    "14. Can you name four of the main challenges in Machine Learning?\n",
    "  - overfitting\n",
    "  - underfitting\n",
    "  - insufficient quantity of data\n",
    "  - non-represenativness of data\n",
    "\n",
    "15. If your model performs great on the training data but generalizes poorly to new instances, what is happening? Can you name three possible solutions?\n",
    "- generalization error \n",
    "  - split data into training and testing\n",
    "  - use validation set\n",
    "  \n",
    "16. What is a test set and why would you want to use it?\n",
    "  - is a subset of data set, which is used to test how well model generalizes to unseen instances of data \n",
    "\n",
    "17. What is the purpose of a validation set?\n",
    "  - purpose is to prevent adaptation of model to testing data, by using cross validation\n",
    "    - training set i\n",
    "\n",
    "18. What can go wrong if you tune hyperparameters using the test set?\n",
    "19. What is cross-validation and why would you prefer it to a validation set?"
